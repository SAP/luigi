We have prepared a brand new Luigi v1.3.0 release with some exciting features.</p>\n<!-- Excerpt -->\n\n<h4 id=\"global-search\">Global search</h4>\n<p>This new feature has the potential to improve your Luigi application dramatically. You can now add a <strong>search toggle</strong> to your app which is displayed in the top navigation. Full functionality is included with the Luigi default settings, but you can also create a custom search that fits your needs exactly. We encourage you to take a look at the full <a href=\"https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/global-search\">documentation</a> and provided example to learn more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fundamental-styles-update\">Fundamental Styles update</h4>\n<p>With Luigi version v1.3.0, the new v0.10.0 of Fundamental Library Styles were included. As a result, there were breaking changes to the Luigi side navigation. You can see the updated layout <a href=\"https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/components/side-navigation.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"support-for-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce\">Support for authorization code flow with PKCE</h4>\n<p>If you use OIDC for authorization, you can now authenticate using <a href=\"https://oauth.net/2/pkce/\">PKCE</a>. You can see the full changes in the code <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/luigi/pull/1478\">here</a>. Fun fact: this issue was fixed by an external developer. We&#39;d like to remind you that Luigi is 100% open source and we love receiving contributions and suggestions on GitHub. If you have any ideas, don&#39;t hesitate to participate.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bugfixes\">Bugfixes</h4>\n<p>For a full list of bugfixes in this release, see our <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/luigi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>.</p>\n",
