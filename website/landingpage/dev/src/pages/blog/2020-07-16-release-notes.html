    <p>The Luigi team has been hard at work even as the summer holiday season begins. We have prepared a brand new Luigi NEXTRELEASE release with some exciting features.</p>
<!-- Excerpt -->

<h4 id="global-search">Global search</h4>
<p>This new feature has the potential to improve your Luigi application dramatically. You can now add a <strong>search toggle</strong> to your app which is displayed in the top navigation. Full functionality is included with the Luigi default settings, but you can also create a custom search that fits your needs exactly. We encourage you to take a look at the full <a href="https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/global-search">documentation</a> and provided example to learn more.</p>
<h4 id="fundamental-styles-update">Fundamental Styles update</h4>
<p>With Luigi version NEXTRELEASE, the new v0.10.0 of Fundamental Library Styles were included. As a result, there were breaking changes to the Luigi side navigation. You can see the updated layout <a href="https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/components/side-navigation.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="support-for-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce">Support for authorization code flow with PKCE</h4>
<p>If you use OIDC for authorization, you can now authenticate using <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">PKCE</a>. You can see the full changes in the code <a href="https://github.com/SAP/luigi/pull/1478">here</a>. Fun fact: this issue was fixed by an external developer. We&#39;d like to remind you that Luigi is 100% open source and we love receiving contributions and suggestions on GitHub. If you have any ideas, don&#39;t hesitate to participate.</p>
<h4 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h4>
<p>For a full list of bugfixes in this release, see our <a href="https://github.com/SAP/luigi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p>
