### Code formatting for contributors

All projects in the repository use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format source code. Run the `npm install` command in the root folder to install it along with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), the Git hooks manager. Both tools ensure proper codebase formatting before committing it.

### Run fiddle locally
