# Luigi Core

## Overview

Luigi Core is a micro frontend framework written in Svelte. To learn how it works, read [this](examples) document.

## Usage

Read the subsections to learn how to use the project.

### Link and build with Lerna

Linking and building with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) is the preferred development method. This monorepo uses Lerna for project management. 

Follow these steps:

1. Install Lerna globally.
    ```bash
    npm install -g lerna
    ```

2. Install dependencies. 
The `lerna bootstrap` command executes the Node Package Manager (NPM) installation and links cross-dependencies.
    ```bash
    lerna bootstrap
    ```

3. Bundle the Luigi Core.
The `lerna run bundle` command runs the `bundle` script in every package referenced in the `lerna.json` file.
    ```bash
    lerna run bundle

    // or non-minified and watcher:
    lerna run bundle-develop
    ```


You can see the Luigi Core in action by running the [Angular example application](/core/examples/luigi-sample-angular).



<!-- 3. Serve public directory
Distribution files generated by `lerna run bundle` and `lerna run bundle` are stored in `core/public` folder. 
Point your local webserver to this directory or use a eg. node based webserver:
```bash
npm install --global local-web-server
0
```` -->

### Run tests

To perform the unit test on JavaScript files, run `npm test`.
