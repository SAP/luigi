# Luigi Core

## Overview

Luigi Core is a micro frontend framework written in Svelte. To learn how it works, read [this](examples) document.

## Usage

Read the subsections to learn how to use the project.

### Link and build with Lerna

Linking and building with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) is the preferred development method. This monorepo uses Lerna for project management. 

Follow these steps:

1. Install Lerna globally.
    ```bash
    npm install -g lerna
    ```

2. Install dependencies. 
The `lerna bootstrap --force-local` command executes the Node Package Manager (NPM) installation and links cross-dependencies.
    ```bash
    lerna bootstrap --force-local
    ```

3. Bundle the Luigi Core.
The `lerna run bundle` command runs the `bundle` script in every package referenced in the `lerna.json` file.
    ```bash
    lerna run bundle

    // or non-minified and watcher:
    lerna run bundle-develop
    ```


You can see the Luigi Core in action by running the [Angular example application](/test/e2e-test-application).

### Build and watch with a simple development environment

Use the following steps, if you want to have a simpler development environment with less output and not the full-blown e2e application. This becomes handy if you want to debug a certain scenario where you already have a luigi configuration snippet.

1. Install dependencies. 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Run webserver with live reload.
    ```bash
    npm run simpledev
    ```

This will create (or use, if already existing) a simple luigi app under /dev-tools/simple-app where you can make changes according to your needs.

<!-- 3. Serve public directory
Distribution files generated by `lerna run bundle` and `lerna run bundle` are stored in `core/public` folder. 
Point your local webserver to this directory or use a eg. node based webserver:
```bash
npm install --global local-web-server
0
```` -->

### Run tests

To perform the unit test on JavaScript files, run `npm test`.
