# Sample Luigi application written in NextJS

## Overview

This is the NextJS-based sample application which runs with Luigi framework.

Due to the nature of NextJS's routing strategy, it is not possible to use `useHashRouting: false` in the Luigi Configuration. If you want to use path based routing, Luigi Core's index.html should be served separately.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
