# Sample Luigi CORE application written in React with Material-UI

## Overview

Example on how to create a Luigi Core based interface from scratch by disabling all built-in graphical interfaces.

> Read the [Write a Luigi Core interface from scratch](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/advanced-scenarios) section in our Expert Scenarios to get a detailed introduction on this implementation.

Be aware this is only a MVP with navigation and a simple profile, and only a limited amount of events are currently available publicly from Core. Please get in touch with us on [Slack](slack.luigi-project.io) if you want to build a Core app from scratch. We are happy to get to know what you are creating and support you with exposing required events.

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrates [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), as well as Luigi Core and Client.

## Development
