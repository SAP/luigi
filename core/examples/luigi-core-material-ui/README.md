# Sample Luigi CORE application written in React with Material-UI

## Overview

Example on how to create a Luigi Core based interface from scratch by disabling all built-in graphical interfaces.

> Read the [Write a Luigi Core interface from scratch](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/advanced-scenarios) in our Expert Scenarios to get a detailed introduction about this implementation.

Be aware this is only a MVP with navigation and a simple profile, currently also only a limited amount of events are available publicly from Core. Please get in touch with us, if you want to build a Core app from scratch. We are happy to get to know what you are creating and give support by exposing required events.

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrates [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), as well as Luigi Core and Client.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd luigi-core-material-ui
npm install

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

2. Run npm start to run this application:

```bash
npm run start
PORT=3000 npm run start // pick a different port
```

Open it in your browser by going to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
