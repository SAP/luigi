## Overview

This is the Svelte-based sample application which runs with the Luigi framework.


## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd luigi-example-svelte
npm install
```

2. Start webpack to run this application:

```

Open it in your browser by going to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

1. Build your application
    ```bash
    npm run build:prod
    ```
