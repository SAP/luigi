# Luigi out-of-the-box features

Luigi does more than help you implement micro frontends - it also provides many additional out-of-the-box features. Their aim is to make your app as consistent and easy to develop as possible. Read more about these additional benefits below:


## Pre-set UI

Do you want an easy-to-configure standardized UI for your app? Luigi can help you implement it. With our Fundamental Styles navigation, all your micro frontends can take advantage of a pre-set global user interface. Learn more about Luigi navigation [here](navigation-configuration).

## Responsive design

Luigi can help you quickly adapt your application to mobile devices and different screen sizes. Find out more [here](#luigi-ux-features.md).

## Security/ID provider abstraction​

Luigi provides authorization plugins which make your app secure and enable users to login with a password. Find out more [here](auhtorization-configuration.md).

## Role-based visibility restrictions

Another way to use Luigi's [authorization](auhtorization-configuration.md) and API features is to make certain parts of your application only visible to some users. This allows for more flexibility and security in your app.

## Notification management​

Implement alerts for your application via the Luigi API. The alerts are displayed in the main app, which means that you save time and effort by developing them globally, and they all have a consistent user-friendly look. Find out more [here](luigi-core-api.md#showAlert).

## Form- and modal management​

Besides alerts, you can also add input forms, messages, and modals via your Luigi configuration. Find out more in our [Luigi Core](luigi-core-api.md#showConfirmationModal) and [Luigi Client](luigi-client-api.md#showConfirmationModal) API documentation.

## Multi language ​support​
