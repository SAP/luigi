## lifecycle

Use the functions and parameters to define the lifecycle of listeners, navigation nodes, and Event data.

### addInitListener

Registers a listener called with the context object as soon as Luigi is instantiated. Defer your application bootstrap if you depend on authentication data coming from Luigi.

#### Parameters

-   `initFn` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the function that is called once Luigi is initialized

### removeInitListener

Removes an init listener.

#### Parameters

-   `id` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the id that was returned by the `addInitListener` function

### addContextUpdateListener

Registers a listener called with the context object upon any navigation change.

#### Parameters

-   `contextUpdatedFn` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the listener function called each time Luigi context changes

### removeContextUpdateListener

Removes a context update listener.

#### Parameters

-   `id` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the id that was returned by the `addContextUpdateListener` function

### getEventData

Returns the context object. Typically it is not required as the [addContextUpdateListener()](#addContextUpdateListener) receives the same values.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** current context data.

### getNodeParams

Returns the node parameters of the active URL.
Node parameters are defined like URL query parameters but with a specific prefix allowing Luigi to pass them to the micro front-end view.  The default prefix is **~** and you can use it in the following way: `https://my.luigi.app/home/products?~sort=asc~page=3`.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** node parameters, where the object property name is the node parameter name without the prefix, and its value is the value of the node parameter. For example `{sort: 'asc', page: 3}`.

### getPathParams

Returns the dynamic path parameters of the active URL.
Path parameters are defined by navigation nodes with a dynamic **pathSegment** value starting with **:**, such as **productId**.
All path parameters in the current navigation path (as defined by the active URL) are returned.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** path parameters, where the object property name is the path parameter name without the prefix, and its value is the actual value of the path parameter. For example `{productId: 1234, ...}`.

## linkManager

The Link Manager allows you to navigate to another route. Use it instead of an internal router to:

-   Route inside micro front-ends.
-   Reflect the route.
-   Keep the navigation state in Luigi.

### navigate

Navigates to the given path in the application hosted by Luigi. It contains either a full absolute path or a relative path without a leading slash that uses the active route as a base. This is the standard navigation.

#### Parameters

-   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** path to be navigated to
-   `sessionId` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** current Luigi **sessionId**
-   `preserveView` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Preserve a view by setting it to `true`. It keeps the current view opened in the background and opens the new route in a new frame. Use the [goBack()](#goBack) function to navigate back. You can use this feature across different levels. Preserved views are discarded as soon as the standard [navigate()](#navigate) function is used instead of [goBack()](#goBack).

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('/overview')
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('users/groups/stakeholders')
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('/settings', null, true) // preserve view
```

### fromContext

Sets the current navigation context to that of a specific parent node which has the [navigationContext](navigation-configuration.md) field declared in the navigation configuration. This navigation context is then used by the `navigate` function.

#### Parameters

-   `navigationContext` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().fromContext('project').navigate('/settings')
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### fromClosestContext

Sets the current navigation context which is then used by the `navigate` function. This has to be a parent navigation context, it is not possible to use the child navigation contexts.

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().fromClosestContext().navigate('/users/groups/stakeholders')
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### withParams

Sends node parameters to the route. The parameters are used by the `navigate` function. Use it optionally in combination with any of the navigation functions and receive it as part of the context object in Luigi Client.

#### Parameters

-   `nodeParams` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager.withParams({foo: "bar"}).navigate("path")

// Can be chained with context setting functions such as:
LuigiClient.linkManager.fromContext("currentTeam").withParams({foo: "bar"}).navigate("path")
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### pathExists

Checks if the path you can navigate to exists in the main application. For example, you can use this helper method conditionally to display a DOM element like a button.

#### Parameters

-   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** path which existence you want to check

#### Examples

```javascript
let pathExists;
 this.luigiClient
 .linkManager()
 .pathExists('projects/pr2')
 .then(
   (pathExists) => {  }
 );
```

Returns **[promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** A promise which resolves to a Boolean variable specifying whether the path exists or not.

### hasBack

Checks if there is one or more preserved views. You can use it to show a **back** button.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** indicating if there is a preserved view you can return to.

### goBack

Discards the active view and navigates back to the last visited view (preserved view), if a preserved view was set before.

#### Parameters

-   `goBackValue` **any** data that is passed in the `goBackContext` field to the last visited view

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().goBack({ foo: 'bar' });
LuigiClient.linkManager().goBack(true);
```

## uxManager

Use the UX Manager to manage the appearance features in Luigi.

### showLoadingIndicator

Adds a backdrop with a loading indicator for the micro front-end frame. This overrides the [loadingIndicator.enabled](navigation-configuration.md#nodes) setting.

### hideLoadingIndicator

Removes the loading indicator. Use it after calling [showLoadingIndicator()](#showLoadingIndicator) or to hide the indicator when you use the [loadingIndicator.hideAutomatically: false](navigation-configuration.md#nodes) node configuration.

### addBackdrop

Adds a backdrop to block the top and side navigation. It is based on the Fundamental UI Modal, which you can use in your micro front-end to achieve the same behavior.

### removeBackdrop

Removes the backdrop.

### setDirtyStatus

This method informs the main application that there are unsaved changes in the current view in the iframe. For example, that can be a view with form fields which were edited but not submitted.

#### Parameters

-   `isDirty` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** tells if the current page or component has any unsaved changes at the moment
