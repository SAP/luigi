## lifecycle

There are various parameters and functions available to Luigi pertaining to the lifecycle of listeners, navigation Nodes, and Event data.

### addInitListener

Registers a listener that is called with a context object as soon as Luigi is instantiated. Defer your application bootstrap if you depend on authentication data from Luigi.

#### Parameters

-   `initFn` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the function that is called once Luigi is initialized

### addContextUpdateListener

Registers a listener that is called upon any navigation change.

#### Parameters

-   `contextUpdatedFn` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the listener function that is called every time Luigi context was changed

### getEventData

Returns the context object. Typically it is not required as the [addContextUpdateListener()](#addContextUpdateListener) receives the same values.

Returns **{idToken: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), sessionId: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), currentEnvironmentId: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}** node parameters.

### getNodeParams

Returns the node parameters of the active URL.
Node parameters are defined like URL query parameters but with a specific prefix allowing them to be passed to the micro front-end view.  The default prefix is **~** and it is used in the following example: `https://my.luigi.app/home/products?~sort=asc~page=3`.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** node parameters, where the object property name is the node parameter name without the prefix, and its value is the value of the node parameter. For example `{sort: 'asc', page: 3}`

### getPathParams

Returns the dynamic path parameters of the active URL.
Path parameters are defined by navigation nodes with a dynamic **pathSegment** value starting with **:** such as `productId`.
All such parameters in the current navigation path (as defined by the active URL) are returned.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** path parameters, where the object property name is the path parameter name without the prefix, and its value is the actual value of the path parameter. For example `{productId: 1234, ...}`

## linkManager

Lets you navigate to another route. Use the Link Manager instead of an internal router to:

-   route inside micro front-ends
-   reflect the route
-   keep the navigation state in Luigi

### navigate

Navigates to the given path in the hosting Luigi app. Contains either a full absolute path or a relative path without a leading slash that uses the active route as a base. This is a classical navigation.

#### Parameters

-   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** path to be navigated to
-   `sessionId` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** current Luigi sessionId
-   `preserveView` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Preserve a view by setting it to `true`. It keeps the current view opened in the background and opens the new route in a new frame. Use the [goBack()](#goBack) function to navigate back afterwards. You can use this feature at unlimited levels. The preserved views are discarded as soon as the standard [navigate()](#navigate) function is used in place of [goBack()](#goBack).

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('/overview')
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('users/groups/stakeholders')
LuigiClient.linkManager().navigate('/settings', null, true) // preserve view
```

### fromContext

Sets the current navigation context to that of a specific parent Node that has the [navigationContext](navigation-configuration.md) field declared in its navigation configuration. This navigation context is then used by navigate function.

#### Parameters

-   `navigationContext` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().fromContext('project').navigate('/settings')
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### fromClosestContext

Sets the current navigation context, which is then be used by the navigate function. This has to be a parent navigation context, it is not possible to go to child navigation contexts.

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().fromClosestContext().navigate('/users/groups/stakeholders')
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### withParams

Sends node parameters to the route, which are then used by the navigate function. Use it optionally in combination with any of the navigation functions and receive it with as part of the context object in Luigi Client.

#### Parameters

-   `nodeParams` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager.withParams({foo: "bar"}).navigate("path")

// Can be chained with context settings functions like this:
LuigiClient.linkManager.fromContext("currentTeam").withParams({foo: "bar"}).navigate("path")
```

Returns **[linkManager](#linkmanager)** link manager instance.

### hasBack

Checks if there are one or more preserved views. Can be used to show a back button.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** a boolean with the information if there is a preserved view available to which a user can return.

### goBack

Discards the active view and navigates back to the last visited view (preserved view), if a preserved view was set before.

#### Parameters

-   `goBackValue` **any** data that is handed over in `goBackContext` field to the last visited view

#### Examples

```javascript
LuigiClient.linkManager().goBack({ foo: 'bar' });
LuigiClient.linkManager().goBack(true);
```

## uxManager

Use the UX Manager to manage the appearance in Luigi.

### showLoadingIndicator

Adds a backdrop with a loading indicator for the micro front-end frame. This overrides the [loadingIndicator.enabled](navigation-configuration.md#nodes) setting.

### hideLoadingIndicator

Removes the loading indicator. Use it after calling [showLoadingIndicator()](#showLoadingIndicator) or to hide the indicator when you use the [loadingIndicator.hideAutomatically: false](navigation-configuration.md#nodes) Node configuration.

### addBackdrop

Adds a backdrop to block the top and side navigation. It is based on Fundamental UI Modal, which you can use in your micro front-end to achieve the same behavior.

### removeBackdrop

Removes the backdrop.
