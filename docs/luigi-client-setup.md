# Luigi Client Installation

Luigi Client contains a library that allows your application to use all features of the Luigi framework.

## Installation

Install the client in your project using npm:
```bash
npm install @luigi-project/client
```

```

or, if you are not using any bundler, Luigi is also available as a global object:

window.LuigiClient
```
You can see Luigi Client in action by running the [Angular example application](/test/e2e-test-application).
