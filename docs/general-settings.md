# General settings

<!-- add-attribute:class:success -->
>**TIP:** For learning and testing purposes, use the [Luigi Fiddle](https://fiddle.luigi-project.io) page where you can configure a sample Luigi application.

The configuration file contains a section called **Settings** where you can configure additional Luigi options. This is an example of how settings parameters can be used:

```javascript
settings: {
  hideNavigation: false
  backdropDisabled : false,
  header: {  object / function / Promise
    logo: 'path/to/image.png',
    title: 'Luigi Demo',
    favicon: 'path/to/favicon.ico'
  },
  featureToggles : {
    queryStringParam: 'ft'
  },
  sideNavFooterText: 'MyLovelyApp 1.0.0',
  sideNavCompactMode: false,
  customTranslationImplementation: () => {
    return {
      getTranslation: (key, interpolations, locale) => {
        return translatedText;
      }
    };
  },
  customSandboxRules: ['allow-downloads-without-user-activation'],
  allowRules: ['microphone'],
  appLoadingIndicator: {
    hideAutomatically: true
  },
  thirdPartyCookieCheck = {
    //thirdPartyCookieScriptLocation: 'https://domain/init.html',
    thirdPartyCookieErrorHandling: () => {
      const alert = {
        text: 'Third Party Cookies are not enabled. Please check your browser settings.',
        type: 'warning'
      };
      Luigi.ux().showAlert(alert);
    }
  },
  theming = {
    themes: () => [
      { id: 'light', name: 'Light Theme' },
      { id: 'dark', name: 'Dark Theme' }
    ],
    defaultTheme: 'light'
  }
}
```

## Parameters

Below is a list of the parameters you can use in the `settings:` Luigi configuration section.
* [General parameters](#general-parameters)
* [Third-party cookies support check](#third-party-cookies-support-check)
* [User settings](#user-settings)

### General parameters

* **hideNavigation** disables Luigi's default out-of-the-box navigation when set to `true`. This means that top, side, and tab navigation is no longer visible and you can implement your own navigation UI. By default, the parameter is set to `false`, which means the navigation is enabled.
* **backdropDisabled** prevents the backdrop layer from covering the top and left navigation when showing modal windows. By default, the backdrop is set to `true`.
* **header.logo** defines the top left navigation logo. It has a fixed height of 28px.
* **header.altText** adds the HTML `alt` attribute to the logo image.
* **header.title** defines the top left navigation title.
* **header.favicon** defines the favicon. It requires a standard favicon file with the `.ico` extension, and 16x16px or 32x32px dimensions.
* **responsiveNavigation** allows customizing the navigation display settings. For example, you can define a button which shows or completely hides the left navigation, or a button which collapses the navigation to only show the icons.
You can set the following values:
  * `simple` displays the button on the left side of the top navigation regardless of the browser windowÂ´s size.
  * `simpleMobileOnly` displays the button on the left side of the top navigation when the browser window is narrower than `600px`.
  * `semiCollapsible` displays the arrow button at the bottom of the left side navigation. Once you click the button, the navigation shows up or collapses.
  * `Fiori3` displays the button on the left side of the top navigation. Once you click the button, the navigation shows up or collapses.<br>
If you don't specify any value for  **responsiveNavigation**, the buttons remain hidden. The same applies when you enable **hideSideNav** for the currently active navigation node.
* **profileType** allows applying different layouts of Profile Menu in Shellbar once a user authorized.
You can set the following values:
  * `simple` displays basic profile menu list of entities.
  * `Fiori3` displays renewed profile menu layout according to Fiori 3 styleguides. It containes avatar of a user, if applicable and additional description. **since**: v1.14.0<br>
If you don't specify any value for **profileType**, the `simple` layout will be used as a default one.
* **burgerTooltip** allows to set and customize a tooltip for the burger, which will be rendered if **responsiveNavigation** is set to `simple` or `Fiori3`. You can set it to `true`. In that case, the default values `Expand navigation` and `Collapse navigation` will be rendered.
It is also possible to customize the values. In that case **burgerTooltip** will be an object with the following properties:
```javascript
burgerTooltip = {
    navExpanded: 'Collapse navigation',
    navCollapsed: 'Expand navigation'
  };
```
* **sideNavFooterText** is a string displayed in a sticky footer inside the side navigation. It is a good place to display the version of your application.
* **sideNavCompactMode** reduces the dimensions of the side navigation and allows you to display more information.
* **customTranslationImplementation** provides a custom localization implementation. It can be an Object or a Function returning an Object. This Object must provide the **getTranslation** Function as property:
```javascript
{
  getTranslation: (key, interpolations, locale) => {
    // should return translation of the 'key' in the 'locale' or current locale
  }
}
```
Take a look at our [i18n](i18n.md) section for an implementation suggestion.
<!-- add-attribute:class:warning -->
> **NOTE:** You can translate Luigi internal messages by providing translation for [these keys](../core/src/utilities/defaultLuigiTranslationTable.js).

* **customSandboxRules** is an array of custom rules for the content in the iframe. You can extend the [Luigi default sandbox rules](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/blob/af1deebb392dcec6490f72576e32eb5853a894bc/core/src/utilities/helpers/iframe-helpers.js#L140) by adding further rules.
* **iframeCreationInterceptor** is a function called on iframe creation. It gives you full control over the created iframe DOM element. You can modify it to your needs just before it is added to the DOM tree.
This function is called with these parameters:
  * `iframe` is the iframe DOM element. It is not yet added to the DOM tree, but all attributes are already set.
  * `viewGroup` is the view group associated with this iframe, if applicable.
  * `navigationNode` is the navigation node associated with this iframe. NOTE: the interceptor is called only once per iframe creation. If two or more navigation nodes share the same iframe (because they belong to the same view group) the interceptor is called with the first navigated node only.
  * `microFrontendType`, which is `main`, `modal`, `split-view`, `drawer` or `usersettings` depending on where it is going to be rendered.

For example, to allow 'fullscreen' for non-modal iframes:
```javascript
{
  iframeCreationInterceptor: (iframe, viewGroup, navigationNode, microFrontendType) => {
    if (microFrontendType !== 'modal')
      iframe.allowFullscreen = true;
  }
}
```
* **allowRules** is an array of rules for the content in the iframe, managed by the HTML **allow** attribute. You can use one or more rules by adding them to the array, for example `allowRules: ['microphone', 'camera']`. Be aware that this mechanism requires the browser to support [Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy).
* **appLoadingIndicator.hideAutomatically** allows you to disable automatic hiding of the app loading indicator, which is enabled by default in case the app loading indicator is being used. Take a look at the [App loading indicator](luigi-ux-features.md#app-loading-indicator) section on how to use this feature.
* **featureToggles.queryStringParam** allows you to set the query parameter name for the feature toggles. This parameter is then used when setting feature toggles via appending to the URL like `?ft=name`. You will need this value set before using the feature toggle functionality.
* **theming** is a configuration element that allows you to specify a list of themes that are available on the website. The children elements:
    * **themes** (mandatory) is an array of available themes, for example `themes: ['light', 'dark']`.
    * **defaultTheme** (mandatory) the default theme used by the application.
    * **nodeViewURLDecorator** (Optional) you can add an internal Luigi View Url decorator (an example is below). This object adds a query parameter where you can add a current theme used by the application when micro-frontends are loaded.

```javascript
theming : {
    themes: () => [
      { id: 'light', name: 'Fiori3 Light' },
      { id: 'dark', name: 'Fiori3 Dark' }
    ],
    defaultTheme: 'light'
    nodeViewURLDecorator: {
       queryStringParameter: {
         keyName: 'sap-theme'
         // optional
          value: themeId => {
            return themeId;
         }
       }
     }
  }
```

### Third-party cookies support check

There are two ways to check whether the user's browser supports third-party cookies:

**thirdPartyCookieCheck** is an object which expects a function called `thirdPartyCookieErrorHandling` and an optional **thirdPartyCookiesScriptLocation** parameter. When **thirdPartyCookiesScriptLocation** is set, the Luigi Core application checks third-party cookie support only once and not on every micro frontend call. If it is *not* set, the Luigi Core application checks third-party cookie support whenever a micro frontend is loaded.
  * `thirdPartyCookieErrorHandling` is a function where you could call an alert like `Luigi.ux().showAlert({})`.
  * **thirdPartyCookieScriptLocation** is the URL to the page containing third-party cookies support check.
To detect whether the user's browser supports the mechanism, use the script in the [`third-party-cookies`](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/tree/master/core/third-party-cookies) catalog. Deploy this file on a domain different from your main application's and set `thirdPartyCookieScriptLocation` to the `init.html` file. During initialization, Luigi detects cookies support and produces an alert if cookies are disabled in the user's browser.
