<!-- 
Generate the changelog using the lerna-changelog tool. 
Run the following command to generate changelog content for pull requests that have been merged since the time when the last git tag was created:

./node_modules/lerna-changelog/bin/cli.js --ignoreCommiters

You can also generate changelog content corresponding to pull requests that were merged in between particular git tags:

./node_modules/lerna-changelog/bin/cli.js --ignoreCommiters --from core-0.3.0 --to core-0.3.1

The lerna-changelog tool detects changes based on PR labels and maps them to sections as per the configuration in the package.json file.
