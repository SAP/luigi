# Community Code of Conduct

## Overview

This document makes a reference to the rules of behavior for all contributors and maintainers in the community. All members agree to follow them to foster the growth of the community of tolerance, respect, and mutual understanding.

## Code of conduct

In the attempt to adopt the best practices from the most renowned open-source projects, our community members undertake to follow the rules outlined in the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.2.0, available [here](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/). Read it to learn about the harassment-free environment, examples of unacceptable behavior, and the responsibilities of the project maintainers.

## Violations

If you observe any instance of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, report it as an issue to the project maintainers specified in the `CODEOWNERS` document.
