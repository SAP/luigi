# luigi-compound-container Based e2e Test App

This folder contains simple HTML files that use **luigi-compound-container** in different scenarios.

They serve as a testing environment for our Cypress tests, which reside in the `container/cypress/e2e` folder.

We try to keep the examples simple and apply separation of concerns. We use plain JS and HTML files to avoid maintaining yet another framework example.
