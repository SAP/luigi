# luigi-compound-container based e2e test app

This folder contains simple html files which apply **luigi-compound-container** in different scenarios.

The purpose of it, is to serve as a testing environment for our Cypress tests which reside on container/cypress/e2e folder

We try to keep our examples here simple and apply separation of concerns. We use plain JS and HTML files to avoid maintaining yet another framework example.
