# Web Component Based luigi-container e2e Test App

This folder contains simple HTML files that use **Web Component** based luigi-container in different scenarios.

They serve as a testing environment for our Cypress tests, which reside in the container/cypress/e2e folder.

We try to keep our examples simple and apply separation of concerns. We use plain JS and HTML files to avoid maintaining yet another framework example.
