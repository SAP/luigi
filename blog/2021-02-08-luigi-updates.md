In this blog post, you can read about the most important Luigi updates in versions 1.7.0, 1.8.0, and 1.9.0.
<!-- Excerpt -->

#### Web components

In Luigi v1.7.0, we introduced a new feature - support for web components, which in the simplest terms means that it is now possible to have multiple micro frontends on the same page. You can find the documentation for web components on our website [here]
(https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/web-component).

#### User settings dialog

### Luigi Client Angular support library

#### Fundamental Library Styles - breaking changes

With Luigi v1.9.0, the new v0.14.0 of Fundamental Library Styles were included. Its previous v0.12.0 led to having breaking changes in the Luigi left side navigation and the shellbar. All icons were moved out from pseudo-classes into a dedicated tag <i class="sap-icon sap-icon--{modifier}"></i> under the button. You can see all breaking changes of Fundamental Library Styles v0.12.0 here.

#### More features
