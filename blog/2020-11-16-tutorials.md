### Luigi tutorials

A new resource to help you learn how Luigi works has been published. It is a group of 6 tutorials which guide you through creating a simple web shopping application. You can find them here: [Luigi Tutorials](https://developers.sap.com/group.luigi-app.html).

>**NOTE**: In order to answer questions and earn points in the tutorials, you need to be logged in. If you don't have an account on [developers.sap.com](https://developers.sap.com/), you can create one for free.

The goal of these tutorials is to provide a beginner-friendly, yet still relatively deep overview of how Luigi works. The tutorials show you how to create an app written in both [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [UI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/). They also include examples of useful Luigi Core and Client API functions. In the end, you can learn how to localize your app and enable it to be displayed in two languages - English and German.

Learning is best done by doing, so we hope these tutorials will be helpful when developing your own applications with Luigi.

If you have any questions or issues with the tutorials, please contact our team on [Slack](https://slack.luigi-project.io).
