<!-- Excerpt -->

#### getUserSettings for web components

In Luigi 2.6, we added the possibility to use the [getUserSettings](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/luigi-client-api/?section=getusersettings) function with [web components](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/web-component). You can find more information in the [pull request](https://github.com/luigi-project/luigi/pull/3414). If you have been following our previous releases, you may notice we already introduced multiple other Luigi Client functions for web components, for example in [Luigi 2.4](https://luigi-project.io/blog/2023-08-23-release-notes#luigi-client-functions-for-web-components).

#### Bugfixes

In Luigi 2.6, we fixed an issue regarding contexts in the left-side navigation. For more information, see the [pull request](https://github.com/luigi-project/luigi/pull/3438). 

You can also check our [changelog](https://github.com/luigi-project/luigi/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of bugfixes in every Luigi release, including minor releases that are not listed on our blog.
