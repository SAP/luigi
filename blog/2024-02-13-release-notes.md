<!-- Excerpt -->


####  Add test id for elements in horizontal navigation

In this release, we've enhanced the horizontal navigation by incorporating a `datatest-id` attribute to HTML elements, facilitating improved testing support.


#### Set view group data via webcomponent api

We have extended the Luigi webcomponent API with the function `setViewGroupData`. Webcomponents are now also able to set view group data like [Luigi Client](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/luigi-client-api?section=setviewgroupdata).
