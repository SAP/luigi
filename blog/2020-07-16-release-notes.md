The Luigi team has been hard at work even as the summer holiday season begins. We have prepared a brand new Luigi v1.3.0 release with some exciting features.
<!-- Excerpt -->

#### Global search

This new feature has the potential to improve your Luigi application dramatically. You can now add a **search toggle** to your app which is displayed in the top navigation. Full functionality is included with the Luigi default settings, but you can also create a custom search that fits your needs exactly. We encourage you to take a look at the full [documentation](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/global-search) and provided example to learn more.

#### Fundamental Styles update

With Luigi version v1.3.0, the new v0.10.0 of Fundamental Library Styles were included. As a result, there were breaking changes to the Luigi side navigation. You can see the updated layout [here](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/components/side-navigation.html).

#### Support for authorization code flow with PKCE

If you use OIDC for authorization, you can now authenticate using [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/). You can see the full changes in the code [here](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/pull/1478). Fun fact: this issue was fixed by an external developer. We'd like to remind you that Luigi is 100% open source and we love receiving contributions and suggestions on GitHub. If you have any ideas, don't hesitate to participate.

#### Bugfixes

For a full list of bugfixes in this release, see our [changelog](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
