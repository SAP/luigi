<!-- Excerpt -->


####  Added an On Close Promise for LuigiClient's openAsModal

We've added a promise to the Luigi Client's openAsModal that resolves when the modal is closed. You can also access the `goBackContext` When you close the modal using LuigiClient.linkManager().goBack({ foo: 'bar' }).


#### Cypress Is Now Supported by the Testing Utilities  

We have extended the scope of Luigi testing utilities to add cypress support. This will help with writing end-to-end (e2e) tests for your Luigi projects.
