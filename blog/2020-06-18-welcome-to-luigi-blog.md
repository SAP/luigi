The new blog section of our website will help you stay on top of the latest Luigi news and updates.
<!-- Excerpt -->

The Luigi project is growing quickly and attracting more attention in the open-source community. Micro frontend architecture is becoming more popular as an efficient strategy for future-proof, scalable applications. New features are added to Luigi regularly, and we want to keep you up to date.

This is why we are adding a blog to our website to inform you of the latest Luigi releases, updates, and other important news! You can expect regular posts in the future documenting every release and other Luigi-related topics. If you have an idea for a blog post, you can write to aleksandra.simeonova@sap.com.

And yes, our first blog post is just to let you know that we have a blog now. #meta #nerdy
