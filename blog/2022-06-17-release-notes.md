You can read about the new features in Luigi v1.23.0 in the release notes below.

<!-- Excerpt -->
#### Disable keyboard accessibility for user settings dialog

When the user settings dialog is opened, it is no longer possible to navigate to other UI elements outside it using the keyboard. For more information see the [pull request](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/pull/2752).

#### getCurrentRoute function

We added a new `getCurrentRoute` function which belongs to the [LinkManager](https://docs.luigi-project.io/docs/luigi-client-api/?section=linkmanager) in Luigi Client. It can be used to get the Luigi route associated with the current micro frontend. The function returns a promise which resolves to a string value specifying the current Luigi route. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/issues/2724).

#### Scalable keyboard accessibility for Language Dropdown

This release brings improvements to the language dropdown within the user settings dialog. For example, it is now possible to navigate through the list of languages using the `up` and `down` arrow keys, while `Enter` selects the item.  You can find more information [here](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/issues/2565).

#### Updated Luigi version in Core examples
The [Luigi Core examples](https://github.com/SAP/luigi/tree/master/core/examples) were updated to the latest version of Luigi. The examples are now using Fundamental Styles v0.23.0, which you can learn more about [here](https://luigi-project.io/blog/2022-05-20-release-notes#update-to-fundamental-styles-v0230).
